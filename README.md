# 🏥 Patient Record System in C

This project is a **C-based console application** that simulates a basic **Patient Record Management System**. It showcases practical memory management using **dynamic memory allocation, reallocation, and deallocation** with structures and linked lists.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new patients with medical history
- ✏️ Update a patient’s medical history
- ❌ Remove a patient from the system
- 📋 Display all patient records
- 🧹 Properly free all allocated memory on exit

## 💡 Concepts Demonstrated

- `malloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()` for dynamic memory management
- Structs and pointers
- Linked lists (insertion, deletion, traversal)
- Safe string handling (`strncpy`, `strcpy`)
- Input validation and buffer cleanup

## 📦 How to Run

1. Copy the code to a file named `patient_system.c`
2. Compile with `gcc` (or any C compiler):
   ```bash
   gcc patient_system.c -o patient_system

## 🧠 Why This Project?
This script demonstrates manual memory control in C — a crucial concept in low-level programming and systems development. It’s especially useful for students and beginners learning about:

- Safe memory allocation practices
- Linked data structures
- Dynamic user input handling

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Language: C

- Compiler: GCC / MinGW / Clang (any standard C compiler)

- Platform: Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS)

## Sample output
    
    1. Add Patient
    2. Update Medical History
    3. Remove Patient
    4. Display Patients
    5. Exit
